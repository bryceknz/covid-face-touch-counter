# COVID-19 Face Touch Counter

>A way to track the number of times you touch your face each day.

So I touch my face. A lot. I want that to change! ([Why?](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200317-how-to-stop-touching-your-face))

I figured, what better way to motivate me to stop than by counting the number of times I do already? Enter, **_covid-face-touch-counter_**!

I've never built a mobile app before, so I thought I'd give [**Expo**](https://expo.io/) a go!
